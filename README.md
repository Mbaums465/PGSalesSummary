## Troubleshooting

### "Please select a valid folder"
- Verify the folder exists and contains `PlayerShopLog_*.txt` files
- Use the **Browse** button to manually select the correct folder
- Check that Project Gorgon has created shop log files

### "No sales found for the applied filters"
- Adjust your date range - logs may not exist for all dates
- Check filter spelling (buyer and item names are case-insensitive)
- Verify the selected folder contains log files

### Script Won't Run
- Check PowerShell execution policy:
  ```powershell
  Get-ExecutionPolicy
  ```
- If restricted, you may need to run:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
- Ensure the `.ps1` file hasn't been corrupted during download

### Missing or Incomplete Data
- Only the **latest version** of each day's log file is processed
- Ensure shop logs are enabled in Project Gorgon settings
- Check that log files aren't corrupted or empty

## Technical Notes

- Item name matching is case-insensitive
- Quantities and prices are formatted with commas for readability
- All price calculations use integer math (rounded values)
- Duplicate log files (same day) - only the highest numbered file is used
